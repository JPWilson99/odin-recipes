            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1.5 cups refried beans (or 1.5 cups drained and rinsed black beans)</li>

            <li>6 large 10-inch flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1.5 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li><em>Optional garnish:</em>finely diced red onion; lettuce; diced tomato or salsa; sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li class="first">Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions.</li>
            <li>To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese.</li>
            <li>Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (until heated through). If you are baking the burritos from the refrigerator while they’re still cold, it will take about 30-35 minutes for them to heat through.</li>
